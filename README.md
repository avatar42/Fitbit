# Fitbit
Started as a quick and dirty program for getting your journal data down loaded before the Aug 27th shutdown of Fitbit custom trackers and journals

I'm adding other down loaders as I need them so best to check the [Wiki](https://github.com/avatar42/Fitbit/wiki) for details and instructions.
